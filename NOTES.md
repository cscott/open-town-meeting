Brief thoughts on UX.

1. Integrated chat system, archived during the hours of Town Meeting to
comply with WA 34.
   - Logged in users can create chat circles; that user maintains control
     of the membership list of their circle, although can transfer it.
   - Any chat can be "public" but you can also click a button to hide all
     comments except for folks in the 'circle'
   - Owner of the circle needs to be able to moderate?
   - Default circle held by site admin with "all TMMs"
     (maybe all "members of Town Meeting" which includes SBs)
   - Bridge to mailing list?
1. Master list of warrant articles, with all related materials linked:
   - Warrant (w/ petitioners), combined reports, supplemental(s)
      - Easy one-click way to "contact petitioners"?
   - Motions made on this warrant article
   - Endorsements broken out:
      1. Official recommendations from Town bodies extracted from reports:
         SB, AC, CTOS, CDICR, ACPH, etc
      2. User can select other endorsements to include, from 3rd parties:
         B4E, PAX, Green Caucus, etc.
         This is a user preference, and none of these are included by default.
   - Upcoming hearings on this warrant article
      1. Link for "how to attend" for meetings with special provisions for
         public comment (AC, SB)
      2. Link for "how to submit written comments"
   - During town meeting, should be linked to the play-by-play for the article
      (ie, expected schedule, speakers list, motion voting order)
1. BUDGET PROCESS master list
   - Each department, linked to online report
   - Upcoming hearings on this department
1. Master calendar: "what's happening today?"
   - Indexed by warrant article
   - Default view is just those hearing that have to do w/ a specific warrant
      article *or the budget*
   - Online/hybrid links where possible
1. List of committees -- this is needed contextually for WA/calendar, etc
   - Membership
   - How to contact
   - Upcoming meetings
   - How to apply
1. Link to TMMA public archive
   - Maybe annotated somehow, searchable, etc.
   - Ie, if you put "WA20" in the subject line it will show up in a "TMMA
     discussion" link on the WA page?
   - Pinned messages w/ important procedural information (usually from the
     moderator although possible Town Clerk messages as well)
1. "Announcements"
   - Site admin probably needs to be able to pin/highlight certain things:
     start of town meeting, changes in the UX, release notes, etc
1. User list
   - This is necessary in order to make "TMM only" chats work; also
     logged in users can customize the list of endorsements they see.
   - For TMMs use the email address registered w/ the Town Clerk to
     automatically create "verified" accounts. (Don't forget also the
     @brooklinema addresses for SB members and other members of TM.)
   - For TMM users, will probably want to link to their voting record,
     and we'll probably want to persist "former TMMs" with a special
     status so that the voting records can stay linked.
1. "Town Meeting"
   - During town meeting it's useful to have a "town meeting night 1",
     "town meeting night 2", etc display on the front page, with the
     articles scheduled/dealt with for each night, and for those which
     have been voted, the results of the vote (linked to recorded votes
     where possible). (We'll need to resurrect the recorded vote coalition.)
1. "Votes"
   - Probably need a separate table to record votes on WA articles
   - Remember to include both recorded and unrecorded votes, only the
     result with a brief qualifier is known for the latter "passed by
     a majority vote", "passed unanimously", etc.
1. Endorsements
   - Uploaded independently by site admin, initially -- maybe eventually
     will make it easier for site users to create and submit these.
   - Initially all recommendations that include more than (say) 5
     warrant articles will be included (want to avoid having individual
     petitioners include endorsements for their single warrant article
     which just recapitulates the information from their article
     explanation, but maybe this can be loosened)
   - Initally we'll just have a big searchable list of "unofficial"
     endorsements, so rely on out of band mechanisms for folks to
     find the endorsements that are relevant to them.
   - Maybe we can make the endorsements more discoverable by providing
     some link on the WA page which allows you to subscribe to endorsements
     which mention that particular warrant article.  This could let you
     easily find (eg) the Green Caucus by searching from a green WA.
   - Once you have a database of votes and endorsements, TMMs can be
     scored by each.  Again, this is a user-controlled feature and no
     unofficial endorsements are available by default.
